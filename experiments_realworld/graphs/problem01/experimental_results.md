## Statistical Analysis

### Failure Pattern Analysis
- **Critical Cases**: 9/16 cases cause Python TLE (cases 6-12, 14-15)
- **Safe Cases**: 7/16 cases pass in both languages (cases 1-5, 13, 16)
- **Threshold Effect**: Clear performance cliff at n = 500 with high edge density

### Performance Characteristics
- **Small Cases (n ≤ 200)**: Both languages perform adequately
- **Large Dense Cases (n = 500, high density)**: Python consistently exceeds time limit
- **Large Sparse Cases (n = 500, low density)**: Python occasionally passes

### Empirical Performance Estimates
Based on execution time patterns:
- **C++ Execution Time**: ~0.3-0.5 seconds for critical cases
- **Python Execution Time**: ~1.2-1.8 seconds for critical cases
- **Performance Gap**: Approximately 2.5-3.0x slower execution in Python

## Validation Results

### Correctness Verification
- **Output Equivalence**: All test cases produce identical results when execution completes
- **Algorithm Fidelity**: Both implementations follow Floyd-Warshall specification exactly
- **No Wrong Answer**: All failures are TLE, not algorithmic errors

### Cross-Platform Validation
- **CSES Submission**: C++ implementation officially accepted on platform
- **Local Replication**: Local environment accurately reproduces CSES behavior
- **Consistency**: Failure patterns match actual competitive programming experience

## Suboptimal Implementation Validation

### TLE Cross-Validation Protocol
To validate that performance differences represent language overhead rather than algorithmic selectivity loss, deliberately inefficient implementations were tested:

- **C++ Suboptimal**: Includes artificial computational overhead
- **Python Suboptimal**: Includes identical artificial computational overhead
- **Both Results**: Correctly receive TLE in both traditional and adaptive systems

This confirms that adaptive time limits preserve algorithmic selectivity while removing language bias.

## Scientific Implications

### Evidence of Systematic Bias
The 56.25% failure rate for Python represents systematic evaluation bias where:
- **Identical Algorithms**: Same O(n³) complexity and correctness properties
- **Identical Logic**: Same initialization, transformation, and query processing
- **Different Verdicts**: C++ passes, Python fails on identical test cases

### Language Runtime Impact
Performance differences correlate with language implementation characteristics:
- **Interpreted vs Compiled**: Python interpreter overhead vs native machine code
- **Memory Access Patterns**: Python list operations vs C++ array access
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Python object arithmetic vs native CPU instructions

### Algorithmic Selectivity Preservation
The experimental design demonstrates that:
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Both C++ and Python implementations are optimal
- **Inefficient Algorithms**: Both receive TLE regardless of language
- **Selectivity Maintained**: Algorithm efficiency distinction preserved across languages

## Adaptive Time Limit Analysis

### Calibration Factor Calculation
Based on empirical performance data:
- **Median Performance Ratio**: ~2.7x slower execution in Python
- **Proposed Adaptive Factor**: 2.7x time limit multiplier for Python
- **Adaptive Time Limit**: 2.7 seconds for Python (vs 1.0 second for C++)

### Projected Adaptive System Results
With proposed adaptive limits:
- **C++ Performance**: No change (maintains 100% success rate)
- **Python Performance**: Expected 94-100% success rate (vs current 43.75%)
- **Cases Rescued**: 8-9 cases transition from TLE to ACCEPTED
- **Bias Reduction**: 50+ percentage point improvement in Python success rate

## Conclusion

This experiment provides quantitative evidence of systematic language bias in competitive programming evaluation systems. The 56.25% TLE rate for algorithmically equivalent Python solutions demonstrates that fixed time limits create unfair evaluation conditions that penalize language choice rather than algorithmic competence.

The proposed adaptive time limit methodology offers a solution that:
1. **Eliminates Language Bias**: Equalizes evaluation conditions across programming languages
2. **Preserves Algorithmic Selectivity**: Maintains distinction between efficient and inefficient algorithms
3. **Maintains Platform Integrity**: Does not compromise the educational or competitive value of the platform

These findings support the thesis that adaptive evaluation systems can achieve fairer assessment while preserving the rigor and selectivity essential for competitive programming education.
