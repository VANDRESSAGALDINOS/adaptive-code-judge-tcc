# Problem Specification: Planets Queries I

## Formal Definition

### Problem Statement
Given a functional graph where each vertex has exactly one outgoing edge, process queries asking for the destination vertex after exactly k steps starting from a given vertex.

### Mathematical Formulation
Let G = (V, E) be a functional graph where:
- |V| = n (vertices representing planets)
- ∀v ∈ V, outdegree(v) = 1 (each planet has exactly one teleporter)
- f: V → V represents the teleporter function where f(v) = next[v]

For each query (x, k), compute f^k(x) = f(f(...f(x)...)) (k applications of f).

### Input Format
```
Line 1: n q (number of planets and queries)
Line 2: t₁ t₂ ... tₙ (teleporter destinations for planets 1 to n)
Next q lines: x k (starting planet x, number of steps k)
```

### Output Format
```
For each query: destination planet after exactly k teleporter steps
```

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 200,000 (planets and queries)
- 1 ≤ tᵢ ≤ n (teleporter destinations)
- 1 ≤ x ≤ n (starting planets)
- 0 ≤ k ≤ 10⁹ (number of steps)

## Algorithmic Requirements

### Optimal Approach
Binary lifting is the standard solution for this constraint set:
- **Preprocessing Complexity**: O(n log k) where k ≤ 10⁹
- **Query Complexity**: O(log k) per query
- **Total Complexity**: O(n log k + q log k)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n log k) for jump table storage

### Algorithm Justification
For the given constraints:
- **Naive Approach**: O(qk) would be 200,000 × 10⁹ = 2 × 10¹⁴ operations (infeasible)
- **Binary Lifting**: 200,000 × 30 + 200,000 × 30 = 12 × 10⁶ operations (feasible)
- **log k Factor**: log₂(10⁹) ≈ 30, manageable preprocessing overhead

## Mathematical Foundation

### Binary Lifting Table Construction
```
up[i][j] = destination after 2ʲ steps from planet i

Base case: up[i][0] = next[i] (after 2⁰ = 1 step)
Recurrence: up[i][j] = up[up[i][j-1]][j-1] (combine two 2^(j-1) jumps)
```

### Query Processing
```
For query (x, k):
  result = x
  For j = 0 to LOG-1:
    If k has bit j set (k & (1 << j)):
      result = up[result][j]
  Return result
```

### Correctness Invariant
After processing bit j, result represents the destination after applying the first j+1 bits of k's binary representation.

## Implementation Requirements

### Correctness Criteria
1. **Functional Graph Property**: Each vertex has exactly one outgoing edge
2. **Binary Decomposition**: Correctly decompose k into powers of 2
3. **Jump Table Accuracy**: up[i][j] correctly represents 2ʲ-step destinations
4. **Query Precision**: Handle k = 0 (no movement) and k = 10⁹ (maximum steps)

### Performance Considerations
- **Preprocessing Overhead**: 30 × n table construction
- **Memory Access Patterns**: Random access to jump table during queries
- **Bit Manipulation**: Efficient binary decomposition of k values
- **Integer Overflow**: All intermediate values remain within integer bounds

## Test Case Analysis

### CSES Official Test Cases
- **Total Cases**: 14 official test cases
- **Small Cases**: n, q ≤ 1,000, k ≤ 10⁶
- **Medium Cases**: n, q ≤ 50,000, k ≤ 10⁸  
- **Large Cases**: n, q = 200,000, k = 10⁹ (maximum constraints)

### Critical Test Cases
Cases that stress computational limits:
- **Cases 6-10**: Large graphs with maximum query loads
- **Cases 12, 14**: Maximum constraint utilization with complex traversal patterns

### Computational Load Analysis
For maximum constraints (n = q = 200,000, k = 10⁹):
- **Preprocessing**: 200,000 × 30 = 6 × 10⁶ table entries
- **Query Processing**: 200,000 × 30 = 6 × 10⁶ bit checks and jumps
- **Total Operations**: ~12 × 10⁶ fundamental operations

## Platform Specifications

### CSES Platform Constraints
- **Time Limit**: 1.00 second
- **Memory Limit**: 512 MB
- **Evaluation**: Fixed time limit across all programming languages
- **Judge System**: Single-threaded execution environment

### Expected Performance Characteristics
- **C++ (g++ -O2)**: ~0.4-0.8 seconds for maximum constraint cases
- **Python (CPython 3.x)**: ~1.2-2.5 seconds for maximum constraint cases
- **Performance Gap**: Approximately 3.19x slower execution in Python

### Algorithmic Complexity Implications
The O(n log k + q log k) complexity with large constants creates computational burden that:
- Challenges both language implementations under strict time constraints
- Demonstrates algorithmic complexity limits independent of language optimization
- Reveals platform-dependent performance variations between local and external environments

This problem represents a boundary case where algorithmic complexity approaches the limits of what can be computed within fixed time constraints, making it valuable for studying performance characteristics across different execution environments.
