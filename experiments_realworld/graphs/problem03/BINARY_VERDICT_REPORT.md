# Binary Verdict Analysis - Problem03 CSES 1750

## Methodology
Applied CSES binary logic: Any TLE in any test case results in REJECTED verdict.

## Results

### Traditional System (1.0s limit)
- **C++**: REJECTED
- **Python**: REJECTED

### Adaptive System (C++: 1.0s, Python: 3.19s)
- **C++**: REJECTED
- **Python**: REJECTED

## Injustice Analysis

- **Injustice Detected**: ❌ NO
- **Injustice Corrected**: ❌ NO
- **Python Rescued**: ❌ NO

## Scientific Impact

Binary verdict methodology reveals true competitive programming injustice that statistical success rates can mask. This approach mirrors real-world online judge behavior where any single TLE results in solution rejection.
