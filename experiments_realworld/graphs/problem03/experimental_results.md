## Critical Test Case Analysis

### Local Environment Failures
Test cases causing Time Limit Exceeded in local environment:
- **Cases 6-10**: Large graphs with maximum query loads (n = q = 200,000)
- **Cases 12, 14**: Maximum constraint utilization with k = 10⁹

### CSES Platform Failures (Python Only)
Test cases causing Python TLE on CSES platform:
- **Cases 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12**: Consistent with local environment patterns
