# Grid Paths Problem Analysis

## Overview

Analysis of backtracking algorithm performance for the Grid Paths problem (CSES 1625). This study examines implementation differences between C++ and Python for computationally intensive recursive algorithms with aggressive pruning strategies.

## Problem Definition

**Input**: 48-character string containing D, U, L, R, and ? characters
**Output**: Number of valid paths in 7×7 grid from (0,0) to (6,0)
**Constraints**: Exactly 48 moves, path must visit each cell at most once

## Algorithm Characteristics

### Computational Complexity
- **Theoretical**: O(4^48) without pruning
- **Practical**: Significantly reduced with pruning strategies
- **Recursion Depth**: Fixed at 48 levels

### Pruning Strategies
1. **Dead-end Detection**: Eliminate cells with fewer than 2 free neighbors
2. **Corridor Prevention**: Detect path splits that isolate grid regions  
3. **Diagonal Pruning**: Check corner accessibility from current position
4. **Early Termination**: Stop when destination reached prematurely

## Implementation Approach

### C++ Implementation
- **Performance**: Consistent execution within time limits
- **Characteristics**: Low function call overhead, efficient memory management
- **Success Rate**: High across diverse test cases

### Python Implementation  
- **Performance**: Variable execution times with timeout occurrences
- **Characteristics**: Higher recursion overhead, interpreted execution
- **Success Rate**: Reduced compared to C++ on identical algorithm

## Key Findings

### Algorithm Equivalence
Both C++ and Python implementations use identical backtracking logic with equivalent pruning strategies. The algorithms are mathematically equivalent in terms of state space exploration and solution counting.

### Performance Characteristics
Significant performance differences observed between languages despite algorithmic equivalence. C++ demonstrates superior performance characteristics for deep recursive problems with intensive computational requirements.

### Practical Implications
The study provides empirical evidence for language selection considerations in competitive programming contexts, particularly for problems requiring extensive recursion with tight time constraints.

## Research Contributions

This analysis contributes to understanding performance trade-offs between compiled and interpreted languages in recursive algorithm implementations, with specific focus on competitive programming constraints.
