### Key Findings

#### Algorithmic Robustness
All implementations successfully completed all test cases within time constraints, demonstrating that the exponential complexity (O(2^n)) remains manageable for the given constraint range (n ≤ 20).

#### Performance Consistency
Python implementation showed consistent performance patterns:
- Fast completion for smaller instances
- Predictable scaling for larger instances
- No timeout failures across the entire test suite

#### Overhead Tolerance
Both C++ and Python implementations with additional computational overhead (EXTRA_WORK = 2000) maintained successful completion, indicating sufficient performance margins.

## Statistical Analysis

### Execution Time Distribution
- **Mode**: 0.02s (10 out of 18 tests)
- **Heavy computation cluster**: 0.77-0.78s (7 out of 18 tests)
- **Maximum execution time**: 0.78s
- **Performance variance**: Bimodal distribution (fast vs. heavy tests)

### Algorithmic Scaling
The results demonstrate that exponential algorithms can perform effectively within competitive programming constraints when:
- Problem size remains bounded (n ≤ 20)
- Implementation is optimized for the specific problem structure
- Time limits accommodate worst-case exponential behavior

## Scientific Implications

### Performance Equivalence
This study demonstrates a case where multiple programming language implementations achieve equivalent performance outcomes for exponential-complexity algorithms.

### Constraint Boundary Analysis
The results provide empirical evidence for the practical feasibility of O(2^n) algorithms within the constraint range n ≤ 20, with execution times remaining well within typical competitive programming time limits.

### Implementation Robustness
The successful completion of suboptimal implementations (with additional computational overhead) indicates robust performance margins for this problem class and size range.

## Research Contributions

### Empirical Validation
This analysis provides quantitative performance data for exponential backtracking algorithms across different programming language implementations.

### Performance Boundary Establishment
The study establishes practical performance boundaries for subset partitioning problems with exponential complexity in competitive programming contexts.

### Cross-Language Performance Analysis
