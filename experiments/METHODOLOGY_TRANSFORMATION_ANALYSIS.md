## Scientific Insights Discovered

### 1. Scale Dependency for Algorithmic Dominance

**Finding**: Critical threshold exists where algorithmic differences dominate containerization overhead.

**Empirical Thresholds**:
- Input Size < 1MB: Docker overhead dominates (invalid results)
- Input Size > 5MB: Algorithmic difference dominates (valid results)
- Critical Ratio: Difference/Overhead ≥ 3:1 for scientific validity

**Implication**: Framework for determining adequate input sizes in containerized performance studies.

### 2. Compiler Optimization Intelligence

**Finding**: GCC intelligently detects and eliminates loops without observable side effects.

**Solution**: Anti-optimization strategies using printf + fflush to prevent elimination.

**Impact**: Enables controlled performance degradation for complexity analysis.

### 3. Container Performance Characterization

**Finding**: Docker overhead exhibits constant ~0.3s startup cost with O(1) scaling behavior.

**Quantification**:
- Overhead: ~0.3s constant
- Python vs C++ performance ratio: 1.4x - 3.3x (consistent)
- Overhead impact: Negligible when inputs are sufficiently large

## Methodological Framework

### Input Size Determination Protocol

1. **Baseline Measurement**: Measure Docker overhead (≈0.3s)
2. **Algorithmic Difference Target**: Aim for ≥3x overhead ratio
3. **Input Scaling**: Increase input size until target ratio achieved
4. **Validation**: Confirm optimal solutions pass, suboptimal solutions fail

### Statistical Rigor Requirements

- Sample size: N ≥ 30 for Central Limit Theorem
- Confidence intervals: 95%
- Statistical tests: Mann-Whitney U + Welch t-test
- Effect size: Cohen's d
- Power analysis: β ≥ 0.8
- Normality testing: Shapiro-Wilk
