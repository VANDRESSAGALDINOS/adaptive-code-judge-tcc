## Core Methodology

### Binary Verdict Analysis
**File**: `methodology/binary_verdict_analysis.md`

**Description**: Fundamental methodology for objective detection of linguistic bias in online judge systems.

**Key Contributions**:
- Exact simulation of real platform logic
- Objective binary criteria (ACCEPTED/REJECTED)
- Replicable framework for any platform
- First scientific formalization in the field

**Applicability**: CSES, AtCoder, LeetCode, HackerRank, any online judge system

## Implementation Framework

### Binary Verdict Framework
**File**: `frameworks/binary_verdict_framework.md`

**Description**: Complete technical framework for implementing binary verdict analysis methodology across different platforms and problems.

**Components**:
- Base classes for analysis execution
- Standardized templates and configurations
- Multi-platform adaptation protocols
- Quality assurance procedures

## Experimental Protocol

### General Experimental Protocol
**File**: `protocols/experimental_protocol.md`

**Description**: Standardized five-phase protocol for executing linguistic bias detection experiments with complete documentation requirements.

**Protocol Phases**:
1. Preparation (problem analysis, data collection)
2. Configuration (parameters, directory structure)
3. Execution (calibration, validation, analysis)
4. Analysis (criteria validation, quality metrics)
5. External validation (real data comparison)

## Scientific Insights

### Algorithmic Complexity Correlation
**File**: `insights/algorithmic_complexity_correlation.md`

**Discovery**: Different algorithmic types exhibit distinct levels of language performance differential, establishing quantifiable relationships between computational complexity and interpreter overhead.

### Recursion Architectural Limitations
**File**: `insights/recursion_architectural_limitations.md`

**Discovery**: Deep recursion in dynamic programming reveals fundamental architectural limitations distinguishing compiled from interpreted languages beyond performance differences.

### Platform Variability Analysis
**File**: `insights/platform_variability_analysis.md`

**Discovery**: Identical algorithms exhibit significant platform-dependent performance variations, demonstrating environment-specific tolerance thresholds impacting bias detection.

### Algorithmic Bias Variability
**File**: `insights/algorithmic_bias_variability.md`

**Discovery**: Not all problems generate algorithmic bias, establishing importance of external validation and case-by-case analysis in bias detection methodology.
