# Architectural Limitations of Deep Recursion in Dynamic Programming

## Scientific Discovery

Analysis of recursive dynamic programming implementations with memoization revealed fundamental architectural limitations that distinguish compiled from interpreted languages in deep recursion contexts, establishing qualitative rather than quantitative performance barriers.

## Experimental Context

**Problem**: CSES 1635 - Coin Combinations I  
**Algorithm**: Recursive Dynamic Programming with Memoization  
**Complexity**: O(n × x) time, O(x) space + O(x) stack depth  
**Constraints**: x ≤ 10^6

## Empirical Observations

### C++ Recursive Implementation
**Status**: ACCEPTED  
**Performance**: Narrow margin (0.47s of 1.0s on critical cases)  
**Stack Depth**: Supports up to x = 10^6 without modifications

### Python Recursive Implementation
**Status**: RUNTIME ERROR (RecursionError)  
**Failure**: Stack overflow on cases with x ≥ 10^6  
**Limitation**: sys.setrecursionlimit() adjustment to 1,100,000 insufficient for pathological cases

## Root Cause Analysis

### Architectural Differences

**C++ (Compiled Language)**:
- Native operating system stack
- Direct memory management
- Minimal overhead per function call
- Stack capacity limited only by physical memory

**Python (Interpreted Language)**:
- Virtualized stack within interpreter
- Security checks per function call
- Significant overhead per function frame
- Artificial recursion limit for crash prevention

### Identified Pathological Case

**Critical Input**: n=1, x=1,000,000, coins=[1]  
**Required Stack Depth**: Exactly 1,000,000 levels  
**Results**:
- C++: Successful execution
- Python: RecursionError despite elevated limits

## Methodological Implications

### Language Comparison Framework

This discovery reveals that certain algorithmic categories present fundamental architectural incompatibility, not merely performance differences. For deep recursive algorithms:

1. **C++ can execute algorithms that Python cannot complete**
2. Comparison shifts from temporal (performance differential) to **technical viability**
3. Recursive algorithms demonstrate **categorical limitations** of interpreted languages

### Online Judge Systems

**Deep recursion problems** create insurmountable barriers for Python submissions, regardless of code optimizations. This constitutes qualitative, not merely quantitative, evaluation bias.

## Proposed Mitigation Strategy

### Adaptive Methodology

For problems where recursion presents architectural limitations:

1. **Maintain recursive implementation** as proof-of-concept for limitations
2. **Implement equivalent iterative version** for fair performance comparison
3. **Document both results** as complementary evidence

### Bias Classification

**Type A - Temporal Bias**: Both languages execute, Python slower  
**Type B - Architectural Bias**: Python incapable of executing algorithm viable in C++

## Scientific Contribution

This discovery strengthens the main thesis by demonstrating that evaluation bias in online judge systems operates across multiple dimensions:

1. **Relative Performance** (time factor)
2. **Algorithmic Viability** (execution capability)
3. **Architectural Limitations** (fundamental differences between language paradigms)

Adaptive systems must consider not only time factors but also technical viability by algorithmic category.
